                    <h4>A revision in online news discussion</h4>
                    <p>Inflo is a context hub for people who want to discuss the news constructively. It combines features of social media and news aggregators â€” with a few key differences: 1) a type-based commentary system for contributing one's input in a structured way, and an insight-based voting system to reward quality insights instead of polarized opinions; and 2) a non-algorithmic, ad-free feed which eliminates the factors that make clickbait and "fake" news lucrative. We don't think we know better than you about what you want to see. So we make it easy: every article that's shared into the network is categorized and labelled, allowing you to easily toggle to the topics and categories you're interested in.</p>
