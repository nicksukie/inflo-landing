                    <p>The Inflo Project is an initiative to revise the way information is accessed and shared on the web. Current social media platforms are breaking down the information ecosystem by indulging in political and financial misincentives, and data is being exploited on a mass scale.</p>

                    <p>That's why we're developing a new social platform meant to empower people to be in control of the content they see, and to reinstate the integrity of published information by rewarding quality over virality, all based on the values of trust, transparency, and community.</p>

                    <h1>Introducing the "Unfeed"</h1>
                    <p>For the first time in history, we will be making it possible to filter a social media feed according to one's individual interests. Through our automatic content classification system, we'll allow users to curate their own intake of information from within their network. No longer do you have to scroll through a endless wall of posts before you find relevant content. Because we believe that a content sharing platform should be meant to nourish, not feed.</p></div>
