<h4>Intelligence to inspire quality content</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>A new, holistic way to gauge reader engagement.</i>
Inflo will be monetized by offering intelligence packages to publishers, allowing them to understand trends of sharing and interaction, and use it to guide their publication initiatives. By transforming in-depth sentiment and opinion analysis into actionable reception indicators, we make it possible to optimize the quality of content, rather than using naive metrics like clicks and likes to evaluate reach and impact. We want to empower publishers with the information needed to not only increase readership, but improve the overall standard of reporting.</p>
